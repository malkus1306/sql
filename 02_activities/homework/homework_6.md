**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

At the end of 2016, I partnered with like-minded professionals to build innovative solutions for vending and coffee businesses. We developed hardware and software products. As part of our solutions, we collect huge amounts of data, store and provide tools to our customers to view and manage these datasets.
In the early days of our venture, we took care of neither the ethics nor inequity components of our solutions, specifically the database. However, our first customers were concerned about the data's security and asked about who and in which capacity has access to data. Indeed, as our team grew more and more people had excessive access to the clients’ data. We performed the following actions:
1) Limited access to the production database for most of the development team
2) Developed the procedures and rules to tackle the questions and boost the confidentiality of the data
3) Added encryption to the most sensitive part of the database.
Another challenge had happened when we decided to launch our business in the European Union (the EU). The EU enforced its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Every company to operate with data in any capacity with any country of the EU must adhere to this regulation. This was extremely challenging as our database had never been designed to delete personal and related data. However, this is the crucial part of the GDPR to delete any important and transaction-related data at the user’s request. It was challenging to implement. From a business perspective such requirements create additional disadvantages for businesses to operate in the EU. However, I believe that this is a forward-looking and wise approach to protect people’s data and create tools to enhance digital and data security.
